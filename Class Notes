My Own Personal Notes (Digital, handwritten in photos)

Jan 10
Github 
Document everything 
Especially when things go wrong
Collaborative
When making a digital thing, make another notebook to upload/record everything
Create notes
When make a new file name, don’t forget file extension
For text use markdown file
Markdown a text file, future proof
.md is markdown
Dillinger.io

*take notes from today and it in github.

Get scan3d app for android. DO NOT AGREE TO BUY
Bring trinket to try scanning

-structure for motion 3d scanning
Requires you rotate around the object
Can take a drone video, and do 3d models from stills
Google earth/maps, mapping every building on planet
First expensive lasers
VR uses scaled down version
Turnstyle lasers
Headphone jack 3d that didn’t work well
All you need is a camera

Constant problem, big companies buy out or shut down programs

How to define when computers are being creative
Neuronetworks = machine learning
Tries to simulate human neurons in code
Technology, providing data
Listen Wikipedia
Human aspect to it, meaningful connection
Is this good art? Wrong questions for history
What are these things? Why are they way they are? 
How did they get this way? What do they mean?
Every tech entangled with different elements (iphone from shanghai, for example)
Historical implications, ethic implications, how these things tell history
Immigration control using same tech to track people down
Framework
Create games for fun
Automate labor
Early program, for machines that wouldn’t exist for over 100 years
Computational have to define boundaries
Archaeology 
Ex, look for slightly different color to determine events
See different history by drawing different boundaries
Find evidence of things that don’t exist but are meaningful (ex the lack of something)
Archaeology intervening 
Vesuvius
People did not have the chance,
Thermal shock kills instantly, makes muscles convulse
Encountered weird voids,
Invent plaster, to fill void
First furniture, then found bodies
False bodies, first casts are very fragile, casts of casts
Sometimes skeletal material still remains
3d scanning, skeuomorph, imposes art on them 
Resin for CAT scans
3d print out these bodies
How do we find bodies of Pompeii, voids to create things
What is meaning of these things
Is this a human body?
Art market = ethical problems
Thought of paul reily 
Permeability vs persistence (qualities of object)
Enchainment vs containment (forces defining processes of assembly/disassembly)
Digital data of object and how they became object
Victim on grid (see slides)
Framework for understanding, things that are now non things, rematerialized in 3d models
Computer is a prothesis(?) for thought
Forces us to think about edges
We don’t know what creativity is in humans
Discussion what is ontological meaning of your project
